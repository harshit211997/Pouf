## Acknowledgments

The game was created during a summer internship at Université Laval, which was funded by mitacs and was done under the supporting guidance of Francis Dubé.

The game was tested and improved by the students of a summer camp held at Université Laval.

I would like to thank Astrid Marin for helping with the game and organizing the summer camp, and the summer camp students who helped in making the game.
